Stepwise Procedure for Performing a Reverse Osmosis Experiment in a Virtual Lab
1. Launch the Virtual Lab

  • Open the virtual reverse osmosis (RO) lab simulator .
2. Select Initial Parameters

  • Choose the type of semipermeable membrane from the “Membrane Type” dropdown menu.
  • Select the feed solution concentration (e.g., salt solution at different ppm) from the “Solution Concentration” selection bar.
  • Set the temperature from the slide bar.

4. Configure the System

  • Adjust the pressure control to your desired starting value. This simulates the pressure applied to the concentrated solution side.
  • Set the desired range for the experiment, if applicable.

5. Start the Experiment

  • Click the “Play” button to begin the simulation. Observe how the system operates under the chosen settings.
  • Watch the virtual flow of water through the membrane, noting the separation of permeate (purified water) and concentrate (waste solution).

6. Observe and Record Data

  • Monitor the virtual readouts for permeate flow rate, pressure, and (if available) solute concentration on both sides of the membrane.
  • Pause the experiment at various intervals using the “Pause” button to record data or make observations.

7. Change Parameters and Repeat

  • Adjust the pressure, membrane type, or solution concentration to see how each variable affects the efficiency of the reverse osmosis process.
  • Use the “Reset Experiment” button to clear previous results and start fresh with new parameters.

8. Analyze Results

  • Compare the effectiveness of different membranes, pressures, and concentrations by reviewing the virtual data collected.
  • Draw conclusions about how each parameter influences water purification in reverse osmosis.
