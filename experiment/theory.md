### Theory 
Reverse osmosis (RO) is a widely used water purification technique that removes impurities from water by pushing it through a special filter called a semipermeable membrane. This membrane has tiny pores that allow only water molecules to pass through while blocking larger particles such as salts, bacteria, viruses, and other contaminants. To understand reverse osmosis, it helps to first know about natural osmosis. Osmosis is the process where water moves from an area with low concentration of dissolved substances (like pure water) to an area with high concentration (like salty water) through a membrane, aiming to equalize the concentration on both sides.
In reverse osmosis, this natural flow is reversed by applying pressure to the side with the higher concentration of dissolved impurities. This pressure forces water molecules to move from the concentrated solution through the membrane to the purer side, leaving behind most of the dissolved salts and impurities. The result is clean, purified water on one side and a concentrated waste solution on the other.
RO is important because it can remove a wide range of contaminants that are difficult to filter out otherwise, such as dissolved salts, heavy metals, and microorganisms. It is used in many applications, including producing drinking water from seawater, treating wastewater, and in industries requiring very pure water. Understanding this process helps students appreciate how science can solve real-world problems like water scarcity and pollution.
