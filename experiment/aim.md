###  To investigate the process of reverse osmosis by demonstrating how the application of pressure can force water through a semipermeable membrane, thereby separating dissolved impurities or salts from the water sample. The experiment seeks to observe the effectiveness of this method in purifying water and to understand the underlying principles of membrane filtration technology.
